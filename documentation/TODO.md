# Experiments
 - bacterial mutation strategy 
   - with different operator for each specimen
   - random operator mixed with modulo stepper
   - bigger problem sizes
 - mutation segment selection
   - use the new cut selector logic
 - local search
   - unify local opt2 with boost operators
 - crossover operators
   - edge selector 
     - optimize segment administration
     - optimize contains
   - sub tour chunks: check implementation
 - initialization
   - review modulo stepper initialization
